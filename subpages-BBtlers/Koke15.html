                    brickbattle tournament series that occurs every year, however, Brickbattlers waited
                    3 years for the sixth Black Flame to happen until Koke finally announced it on Mid-2024. <br>

                <div class="body bodycolorpurple">
                    <p> Koke began brickbattling in the winter of 2010.
                        His begginings involved the goal of joining Prymed,
                        the main hub at the time, however, he got rejected
                        a few times due to being a newbie until he achieved
                        the needed skill to join, later, he was also welcomed
                        into Brick Kings. <br>

                        <br>
                        Eventually, the demise of Brick Kings made Koke to go 
                        inactive, returning in 2016 where a lack of brickbattlers 
                        was noticeable, creating "Order Of Brickbattle". 
                        In late 2017, He assisted in the creation of 
                        "Temple Of Brickbattle", becoming a rankmaster in the 
                        group, gaining recognition as a community leader. <br> 
                        
                        <br>

                        Additionally, he created "Black Flame",
                        an ongoing series of tournaments based on the
                        Roblox Grand Melee, and one of the most important 
                        tournaments on modern brickbattle... the Black Flame
                        has now reached its sixth iteration in 2024. <br>
                        
                        <br>

                        After the incident surrounding GFink's expulsion, 
                        ownership of T.O.B. was granted to Koke, 
                        due to his good leadership and ideas.

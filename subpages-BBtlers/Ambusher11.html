                <div class="body bodycolordarkblue">
                    Ambusher11, currently known as PunishedAmbusher is a veteran brickbattler that
                    began brickbattling in 2009 and became less active in later 2010's. <br>

                    He is known for being one of the participants in the Roblox Grand Melee, and 
                    is one, if not the only, oldest brickbattlers that remain active until today
                    (though not very active right now), in terms of join date. <br>

                    Ambusher barely logs into his account, but he joins time-to-time and sometimes
                    plays on TOBs events.

                    <p> Ambusher11 began brickbattling in 2009 and 
                        eventually gained recognition in the brickbattle
                        community, he is not very active right now but 
                        he still interacts with other brickbattlers.

                        <h2> Unfair termination </h2>
                        In 2020, Ambusher's account was falsely terminated. An
                        user targeted Ambusher and submitted a support ticket 
                        written in all caps and filled with curses, requesting 
                        the termination of Ambusher's account. Unfortunately, 
                        the ticket was approved, resulting in the termination of 
                        Ambusher11's account for being 'compromised.' Appeals were 
                        denied, with the support team stating that he was 
                        'not the owner of the account.' Ambusher shared this incident 
                        on Roblox's subreddit, but the post was later removed by subreddit
                        moderators due to a rule violation. While he remained active on the platform, 
                        his original 12-year-old account (at the time) was permanently lost. 
                        However, he returned under his new account, PunishedAmbusher, 
                        which he continues to use to this day. The subreddit post's comment 
                        section was filled with replies from users expressing their disappointment 
                        with Roblox for approving such a poorly made ticket. This incident 
                        is remembered as one of the most unfair decisions by Roblox staff. <br>
                        <br>
                        The responsible for Ambusher's ban was Ziraxiam, a problematic 
                        user who had understanding on how reports worked, and could use 
                        that to his advantage, however, sometime after what happened, Ziraxiam 
                        left the internet, due to being targeted and constantly attacked 
                        by the community for everything he has done.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Ambusher is one if not the only ROBLOX veteran that is still around in the brickbattle 
                        community, he doesnt play Roblox much, but he is still in contact and interacts
                        with it frequently.

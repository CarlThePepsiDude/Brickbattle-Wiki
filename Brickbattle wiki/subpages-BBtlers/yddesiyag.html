                        yddesiyag was a Crossroads player back in 2014, going under the
                        name of "thefurrycheetah3d", at a very young age, meeting "Madsanity"
                        during his frequent times playing the game, he would later stop
                        playing the game after a year.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        He would begin brickbattling around August 2019, after stumbling
                        across Doomspire Brickbattle, and revisiting Crossroads, an user
                        by the name "EarlDeer" asked yddesiyag to duel in gameboy's private
                        Crossroads, where EarlDeer would defeat yddesiyag 7 - 0, the duel
                        triggered cheetah's interest in brickbattling again.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        He then would lurk in Crossroads or Junkkid's private Crossroads, meeting
                        more brickbattlers, in less of 3 weeks, Thegameboy did a private ranktest
                        to cheetah, that finished with cheetah earning the Warrior rank.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        yddesiyag made contact with an inner community when an user called "NewtonVolta9"
                        invited him to the group Covenant of Brickbattlers.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        In 2020, yddesiyag would earn the Master rank after defeating
                        other Masters and being ranktested by Sockjoke during the Ballerroads Tournament,
                        and later would win the first 2v2 tournament along with Boy4u2.
                        and during Late 2022, he was awarded with the Grandmaster rank
                        after winning the BBC Tournament.

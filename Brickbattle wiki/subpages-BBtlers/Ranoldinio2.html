                    ranoldinio2, or simply Ran as his friends call him, 
                    is a very well-known and skilled Brickbattler with 
                    many years of activity. He still holds that title 
                    to this day. Ran has been a consistent participant 
                    in the Black Flame tournament series, earning the 
                    title of 'Black Iron Champion' in both BF1 and BF2. 
                    Ranoldinio is the founder of the group "Brickbattle Bloxxers", 
                    which is affiliated with T.O.B.

                    <p> Ranoldinio2 started Brickbattling in 2011. By 2013, 
                        Ran became a prominent player, especially after 
                        defeating Tyler9698. Since then, his journey of 
                        improvement as a Brickbattler began, winning the 
                        first two Black Flames organized by Koke15 and gradually 
                        becoming more recognizable. To this day, he remains a 
                        cheerleader for the community and is still active.

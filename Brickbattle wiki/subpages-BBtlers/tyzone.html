                        tyzone didn't instantly joined the community, around 2008 - 2009, he was
                        a constant Crossroads player, without being aware of an inner brickbattling
                        community, therefore, he learned experience for the future, 
                        it wasn't until January 2020, where thanks to a video talking about modern brickbattle,
                        he became interested enought to make the first contact with the community, after the video,
                        he played in Chaos Canyon and met "accurative", after a duel, he got invested into
                        high-level brickbattle, now being more active on Crossroads.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        After some time, he would met members of the Covenant Of Brickbattlers group
                        and was later invited into the group in May of the same year.

                        <br>

                        As of some time between May and April of 2020, he earned the Knight rank on
                        his first ranktest, and when Black FLame 4 began, he achieved the
                        Centurion rank.


                        <h2> Tyzone's works </h2>

                        While interested in competition, tyzone began working on projects
                        that would later make him known, models like a tool visualizer, a
                        custom gravity Crossroads, a practice game, and the brickbattle
                        timeline project.

                        <span style="color: blue;"> Editor's note: The last game is the inspiration
                            for this wiki!! :D
                        </span>

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        His most memorable works are helping in the Ultimate Toolset, the spectator mode
                        used in most of the current brickbattle games, and his game "Brickbattle Frenzy",
                        where he worked on training bots that have a good ai, they can attack other players,
                        bomb jump, and follow each gamemode objetive.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Before going inactive in the community, he wanted to revamp the ultimate toolset into
                        something that had every performance improvement, but due to it not being as much
                        of a chore to edit, it never became a thing.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        tyzone is remembered as one of the users who most offered content
                        for the community.

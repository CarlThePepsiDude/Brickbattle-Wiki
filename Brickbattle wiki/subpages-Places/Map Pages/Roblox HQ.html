                   Roblox World Headquarters, or Roblox HQ for short, is a map created by Shedletsky and hosted in Builderman's
                   account, the main building is conformed by two towers, connected by a bridge, the left-tower haves an R in the
                   front face, inside the towers there are placed dummys of the ROBLOX admins, there are other structures in the map,
                   a tower in ruins at the corner of a lake, and taken from the Beta versions of Crossroads, the medical house and a
                   castle.
                    <br>

                    to this day, the game has been privated, due to the toolset breaking, the game can still be opened trought studio.

                   This place used to be builderman's starter place until Shedletsky updated the game by creating the map we know
                   today, the map features two buildings, with ROBLOX admins inside them, in the left-tower, Matt Duseck and Stoecker
                   are in the basement, and in the office at second floor, Erik Cassel is on the seat, and next to him is Telamon(Shedletsky).

                   In the right-tower, Clockwork and Wookong are in the basement, and Builderman is sitting in the office

                    
                   <br>
                   <br>

                   The map is known for having more than 5.000 bricks, the more the towers are destroyed, more lag it will cause, and since
                   there are no regen scripts, the game becomes unplayable at that point, the players are given the classic brickbattle toolset
                   with the addition of the jet boots.
                
                   <br>
                   <br>

                   The game can only be played in multyplayer via recreations, in that case, brickbattlers often fight outside the towers
                   to prevent the game from lagging, while sometimes people only join to fest on the thousands of bricks at 16 fps, most of
                   the videos about Roblox HQ are about it being completely nuked in high speed to hide the low fps and to give a more
                   epic looking of the destruction of the towers.

                        The game was intended to be a team based game, that is why the team beacons where designed,
                        since the teams feature wasnt a thing back then.

                        Brickbattlers often refer to the original Crossroads game as "1818", its ID, since many edited versions

                        This map is one of the oldest assets to exist in ROBLOX, it can be noticed by the low ID number

                    Crossroads is one of the first games on ROBLOX, 
                    also the first Brickbattle game ever made. 
                    Crossroads was created by Telamon, and is a symbol of the early days of ROBLOX.

                    Months before ROBLOX's official release, the game when trought a lot of testing, 
                    the principal goal was testing the multyplayer hosting, due to this, Crossroads was 
                    born along with more games that got released after it, Crossroads went trought different 
                    versions and updates. many of its early versions has been documented.

                    <h2> CROSSROADS BETA </h2>

                    <p>
                    Crossroads haves different betas, its first iteration takes place in May 2006, 
                    before Crossroads was called "Crossroads", it was named as "Shooting Gallery", 
                    this version only had a few buildings, and was almost empty. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    This version of crossroads only had a few trees, a castle (later used on roblox HQ), 
                    a house (later the medical station at roblox HQ), and a green bridge that later would work as 
                    the blacrock's castle brown bridge. During that time, the game was just a showcase map, 
                    but turned into a fighting game when Shedletsky started to work at ROBLOX.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By Shedletsky's words, when he joined ROBLOX, Eric and David(Builderman) were struggling with 
                    creating Crossroads, so he helped and did significant advancement to the game, the first update 
                    of Crossroads got released on late June 2006. The game's toolset consisted of rocket launcher, 
                    slingshot, and the move tool, later the trowel was added to the game. This first update added the 
                    Free bricks area (later used in Happy Home In Robloxia), a new wing for the castle, and a tower.    
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    In August 2006, the free bricks area got replaced with Thieves' Den, behind it 2 cyan walls were placed, 
                    and the medical station got replaced with the lost temple, during a timespawn, a watch tower was added to 
                    the castle, then the castle got replaced with the Blackrock's castle we have nowadays, with the exception 
                    that there was bigger watch tower instead of the black mountain from the final version. with this update, 
                    the weapons got a recode, plus the addition of the Superball and Timebomb 
                    </p>

                     At the beggining of September, Crossroads started to look more like the map we know today, 
                     blackrock got its watch tower removed and received a high mountain instead, and the Lost Temple 
                     got the spinning red bar, and the Team Beacons where added, at March 2007, the game got revamped
                     entirely, the cyan walls got removed, the trampoline was added and the skybox was changed, plus a 
                     day-night cycle, billboards where placed, and the hopperbins got replaced by working tools. The 
                     Sword and paintball gun got added in May 2007.

                     Crossroads is well-known among the veteran side of the community, as it was where all the Brickbattlers 
                     would practice during Roblox's early era. Crossroads was often highly populated, with every group or 
                     Brickbattle clan gathering there to practice or spread their influence. However, by 2014, Crossroads 
                     began to suffer from a lack of players, with servers now hosting only 0â€“10 players at a time. 
                     On September 17, 2017, the game was taken down due to concerns regarding FilteringEnabled but was shortly 
                     republished with dynamic lighting, aftereffects, and filtering enabled. On August 7, 2017, T.O.B published 
                     a remake of Crossroads, featuring the same map but with different tools and new techniques. This iteration 
                     has become more popular, often attracting up to 15 players daily, while the original game now averages 
                     only 5 players per day.

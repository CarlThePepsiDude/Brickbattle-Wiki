            <p> WHAT IS THIS? </p>
        </div>

    <div class="body bodycolorblue">
    <p> This is a website that records info about brickbattling, for new people in the community to get
        along with the surrounding and for veterans to remember they'r past experiences.</p>

            <p> WHY? </p>
        </div>

    <div class="body bodycolorblue">
    <p> A lot of archiving projects about brickbattling have been worked on by other users, and since i wanted
        a reason to learn html, this was the perfect chance, i mean, this genre and its community exists since 2006, there's more
        than enought to type about lol, one of the archiving projects that inspired me to do this is
        tyzone's "Brickbattle timeline" game, where much of the information here is taken from that game,
        a huge shotout to him!! </p>

            <p> INFORMATION VERICITY </p>
        </div>

    <div class="body bodycolorblue">
    <p> Some info is lost, or only is known because of the testimonys that someone haves, that means, you need
        to take the information here with your fingertips, much of the stuff here are people's witnesses and
        experiences, and for the brickbattlers, i try to get in contact with 'em to see if the information is
        correct. </p>

                    Chaos Canyon is the second brickbattle map ever made in ROBLOX, 
                    unlike other brickbattle maps, this map has been build by collaboration 
                    between roblox admins (Telamon, Stealth Pilot, Tingc222, and Yahoo), this 
                    map is often seen as the second classic map just behind Crossroads, sadly, 
                    this map didnt had the same success as Crossroads or Rocket arena, but in its 
                    prime it got a big number of players and is placed on the memoryes of all the ROBLOX veterans.

                   Some moments right before its release, ROBLOX was going under a testing period, 
                   focused on multyplayer servers, as a result of this, Chaos Canyon is released along with other games 
                   in an account named arena2, the map was later moved to be hosted by roblox's official account.
                   This map is one of the few, if not the first map created by a group of roblox users instead of just one, 
                   in this case, the map was created by roblox administrators. Chaos Canyon used the same brickbattle toolset, 
                   with the difference that a different weapon would replace the sword, this one being the flamethrower. Chaos 
                   Canyon didnt got much public as Crossroads, but it was popular in its peak age.

                   <br>
                   in 2011, the game received a reskin, with updated textures and a new color pallete. Unfortunately, as of 2017, 
                   due to updates, the game broke, and it would crash the game upon joining, and finally some time later, it would 
                   finally be privatized, to this day, the game remains unplayable, but it is still accesible via roblox studio, but 
                   it remains broken.

                   The only way to play the map nowadays, is via recreations or the Super Brickbattle Plaza game in Temple Of Brickbattle,
                   which features this map alongside much more.

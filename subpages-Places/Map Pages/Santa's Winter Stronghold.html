                   <p>  
                   Santa's Winter Stronghold is a game made by Shedletsky during the Christmass of 2006,
                   it is a team based game, the teams are not implemented in the game since the lack of
                   team services in studio back in the day, but the game is mostly focused in Santa vs
                   Elves, Elves need to catch as much gifts as they can while a player chosen as Santa will
                   try to stop them from doing it.
                    <br>
                   The game is now hosted in the ROBLOX account, its broken, and it has shut down, but it is uncopylocked.

                <div class="body bodycolorweakblue">
                    <p> 
                   Back during the Christmass of 2006, Shedletsky wanted to create a map
                   where getting K.O's wheren't the only goal for a brickbattle game, as a result,
                   Santa's Winter Stronghold was released, along with the game, three days later,
                   Shedletsky posted in the ROBLOX blog about how the game worked and also gave
                   hints for each team to help the players.
                    
                   <br>
                   <br>

                   In the game, The elves are making a riot against Santa, they now want the presents,
                   and Santa must stop them, every round lasts 8 minutes, when the time runs out, the 
                   player with the most points wins.
                    
                   
                   <h2> THE ELVES </h2>
                   
                   Elves are equipped with a trowel, snowballs, a bomb, a slingshot, and a rocket launcher.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   The elves need to steal the presents, while also avoiding the powerfull Santa, as an elf,
                   you have to work with other elves to catch presents, since teams are not really implemented
                   in the game, friendly fire is on, however, it is your choice to help your team, just keep in mind
                   that being greedy and betraying your fellow elves may come with a punishment, elves always
                   spawn at the starting cliff, and the map is pretty big, getting pwned by Santa or your teammates 
                   isnt a good idea, so keep a good eye.

                   <br>
                   <br>

                   As an elf, there are three treasures in the map: the far corner of the map behind ice, in the Santa's
                   throne and in the black tunnel by the frozen lake, Santa may be aware of the presents so stay alert too,
                   he may destroy some parts of the map to prevent you from getting the presents.
                   
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   Each present is worth 1 point, bloxing Santa gives you 3 points, but bloxxing other elfs will not give
                   you any points. it is recommended to not fight the Cookies and Milk lover alone.
                

                   <h2>SANTA</h2>
                
                   Santa is equipped with the same tools as an elf, two extra habilityes, a Multirocket launcher, and
                   the Jet Boots, The Multirocket Launcher allows you to shoot rockets 3 times faster than normal, and the Jet
                   Boots allows you to fly, and reach parts of the map faster.
                   <br>
                   <br>

                   A random player in the server (or the one who joined the game first), will be chosen to be Santa, as Santa,
                   you need to hunt those pesky elves in order to prevent them from stealing your presents.

                   Santa is better armed than the elves, getting rid of one will be too easy, but it is recommended to not fight
                   all of them at once, destroy bridges and structures in the map to prevent Elves from reaching the presents,
                   the Jet Boots will give you better access to the map than the elves, you can knock pressents from the map with
                   snowballs.

                   <br>
                   <br>

                   Bloxxing Elves gives you 1 point, beware, bloxxing yourself will make you lose 5 points.

                   The Grand Melee Arena is a colosseum made by Shedletsky for the Roblox Grand Melee tournament, it was
                   used for the final round of the tournament, the main arena is closed with invisible insta-kill walls
                   to prevent non-finalist players to interrupt, there where messages at the top (hints), announcing
                   the final round and advicing that incoming spectators could be kicked from the game if the limit of
                   players was reached.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   The game is now broken, but is uncopylocked and can also be played online.

                   The map was made and hosted in the "GrandMelee" account as well as the past two rounds, The colosseum
                   is conformed of an entrance with stairs, and the Grand Melee logo at the sides, inside, there is the main
                   arena where only the "Gladiators" team were allowed, team which was conformed of the finalist of the
                   tournament, those on the Spectators team could only watch, any attempt to jump into the arena would be greated
                   by getting bloxxed by invisble insta-kill walls protecting the arena, the finnalist would spawn inside the arena
                   in any of the 16 spawns placed around the arena, as well as respawn, there where also 4 Grand Melee logos in the
                   invisible walls in each side of the arena.                 
                   <br>
                   <br>

                   For the spectators, there where stairs that leads to the second and third floors, where they can see the fight,
                   there is also another entrance via stairs that leads to a basement with a door where you could
                   access the arena, but it was closed with a wall for already mentioned reasons.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   the whole colosseum is placed in a green baseplate and a gray road for the entrance.
                
                   <br>
                   <br>

                   As of now, the map is public and can be played, but its broken, all of the brickbattle classic weapons are used
                   except for the paintballgun, there are not much recreations of the Grand Melee as a stand alone map, but it can
                   be seen in other games.

                   <br>
                   <br>
                   Since the Grand Melee Arena has been uncopylocked since its release during the tournament, users would reupload it and
                   change the scripts containing the users allowed in the arena, so they could play the map properly with friends.

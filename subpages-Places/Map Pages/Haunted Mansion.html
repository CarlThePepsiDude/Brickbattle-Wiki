                   During the Halloween of 2006, Shedletsky created and released the game under ROBLOX's profile, the
                   mansion itself haves a variety of rooms to explore, outside the mansion, there is a pumpkin farm
                   with a scarecrow, a lake, and a playground behind the castle.

                   <h2> Inside The Mansion </h2>

                   The entrance room haves a hole that leads to the underground cave, theres a restroom with
                   furnitures and a fireplace, theres also a room with a dinner table, a kitchen with a fridge with heads
                   int it, the stairs lead to the second floor, with a balcony, two beds and a room with a bed and a cabinet.

                   <br>
                   <br>

                   Theres another entrance to the mansion in the left, which leads to the Red room, the stairs in the red room
                   will lead to the underground cave, thought most part of it is behind a small window, theres a fake wall that
                   hides the Witches room, inside, theres a pot, the liquid on it will make the player's head bigger and will 
                   change it to a random color, it will kill upon contact, there are also a desk with papers and a cabinet with
                   heads of different sizes, however, nowadays, it is broken, it will give the effects on the head of the player
                   but will not kill them.

                   <br>
                   <br>

                   the balcony haves a ledge that leads to the ceiling, and outside the mansion, there is a mountain with a hole that
                   leads to the basement cave, in the cave, there are pillars and stairs, there are also 2 different doors, one leads
                   to the playground and one leads to the lake.
                    

                   <h3> Halloween toolset </h3>

                   The players are given the move tool, a rocket launcher, slinghost and bomb, the last three mentioned have went trought
                   a re-skin to match the Halloween ambience, the rocket launcher's rockets are organge, the slinghosts are replaced with
                   heads, and the bomb is replaced with a pumpkin, there is also a teleporter that sends you to the mountain with the pit,
                   making you fall to the underground cave, there is also the Jet Boots, that have been reskinned to a ghost effect.

                   As today, the game is broken, and the weapons dont work, however the game is public in Shedletsky's account and its
                   uncopylocked.
